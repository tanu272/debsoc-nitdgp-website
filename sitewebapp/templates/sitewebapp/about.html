        <h5>
          The Debating Society, NIT Durgapur, was founded in the year 2015 through the sincere efforts of a group of five dedicated and committed individuals. What started off as an unofficial initiative by a handful of students back in day, has now evolved to its present scale and stature. What remains unchanged though, is the devotion and sense of pride taken in the club by each one of its thirty present members, as well as by our illustrious alumni.

          Through a number of small and medium scale events, this club has built its reputation up from scratch. Our work speaks for us. It is hard to believe what we have achieved in a mere couple of years since the conception of this club - bringing it to a respectable level where it can now proudly stand, shoulder to shoulder, with the other clubs and organisations within the college that have had many many years to prove their mettle. 
          
          At its core, The Debating Society, NIT Durgapur, is an ideological interest group that aims to promote the culture of debating on campus and provides a platform to unite all debaters. We work with a mission to encourage the youth to actively involve themselves in issues concerning social interest and upsurge, and to make them articulate enough to present their opinion in a coherent and logical manner. As responsible citizens, we feel the need to raise our voices when the nation calls upon. The club also conducts workshops and intra-college debates to help the students develop confidence to voice their opinion on a bigger platform, subsequently, and represents NIT Durgapur in various debating competitions across the country. Where we differ from most other debating clubs across a wide range of institutions across the country is that we focus on incorporating tech to our practices as well. We have made a name for ourselves in the Eastern and Central circuits and we hope to win further laurels for the institute and become a well known name on the debating circuit.
